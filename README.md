I have developed a Weather Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with a weather API. This application allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for a specific location. The app displays key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, providing a quick and user-friendly way to check the current weather conditions.
